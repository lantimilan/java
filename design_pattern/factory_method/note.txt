Why do you need a factory method?

Answer:
1. How do you instatiate an object? The answer is to call constructor.
2. How do you instatiate a set of objects? The answer is to call the respective constructor. But then your code will look ugly when the set of objects are related, say they all implement a common interface.

It would help if the interface could have a virtual constructor and all the classes that implement it override that virtual constructor. Unfortunately construtor cannot be virtual so we have to simulate it, by using a member function.

interface Shape {}
class Circle implements Shape {}
class Square implements Shape {}

class ShapeFactory {
  public Shape createShape(String name) {
    if (name == "circle") return new Circle();
    if (name == "square") return new Square();
  }
}

class Test {
    ArrayList<Shape> diagram;
    String[] names;
    ShapeFactory factory;
    for (int i=0; i<names.length(); ++i) {
        diagram.add(factory.createShape(names[i]));
    }
}

The above is clearly not flexible as the ShapeFactory has to know all the
shapes, Circle, Square, etc, although it has the advantage to make the Factory a
singleton.  A more flexible solution is to have abstract Factory and concrete
Factory. This allows a client to create objects from a concrete factory, with
knowledge to that concrete factory only.

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape() {
    }
}

class CircleFactory {
    public Shape createShape() {
        return new Circle();
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String args) {
        // only this line needs to change if want new type of object
        ShapeFactory fac = new CircleFactory();
        Shape obj = fac.createShape();
    }
}
